* AA222 project: Bayesian Structure Learning and Causal Discovery Using Generalized Disjunctive Programming

#+begin_quote
In this project we provide a new formulation for Bayesian Network Discovery, leverag ing
a novel formulation using Generalized Disjunctive Programming, and evaluating the
formulationâ€™s efficacy. We present the assumptions, formulation, and implementation,
and discuss performance results. We also comment on the relations to the more difficult
problem of Causal Structure Identification and show that under some assumptions our
method recovers the correct causal graph.

*** TLDR: The problem formulation as GDP
We assume a linear model with non-Gaussian noise (required for identifiability).
The edge weights between variables are given as $X$, and the data is used to construct $S$. Then we formulate the problem as:
